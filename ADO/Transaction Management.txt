Transaction Management System : locking mechanisms, works on locking policy that changes based on the level of Isolation

Transaction Isolation Levels :
1. Serializable : Highest level of Isolation. Exclusive range of locks are applied.
2. Repeatable Read : Second Highest level. Same as Serializable, but does not acquire range of locks. Phantom reda are possible
3. Read Committed : Acquires Shared lock and allows reading only committed data. Avoids read changes as a part of the transaction
4. Read Uncommitted : Lowest level. Allows dirty reads

Reading Mechanism : 
 - Dirty Read : one transaction reads the changed values/data of another transaction, which is yet to be committed. When We make a decision based on the uncommitted data, and then the transaction is rolled back, creates a bug in the application

 - Non Repeatable Read : A transaction reads the same data from the same table multiple times, the there can a problem of looking at different values for every read

 - Phantom Read : A transaction reads a table first and finds x number of rows. A problem can creep in when the same transaction goes for another read, it may find x+1 rows


Transaction Scope : is an object that ensures all operations within the scope are treated as a single unit of work, maintaining consistency and integrity.
 - It does not require us to create a separate transaction
 - It will automatically manage ambient transaction and does not need connection transaction
     Ambient Transaction : 
     --------------------
A transaction which on its own identifies a block of code that needs the support of transaction, without we explicitly mentioning.
     Connection Transaction :
     ----------------------- 
  Transactions that are tied directly to the SqlConnection Object.
