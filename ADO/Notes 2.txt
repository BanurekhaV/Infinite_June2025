When to Use Data Sets : 
  - Complex Structures in application with multiple tables and relationships. Acts like a mirror to a RDBMS
  - Disconnected Manipulation : When we want to work offline. All changes are made locally and then updated at the database
  - Data Serialization
  - Reporting and Data Analysis
  - Hierarchial Data
  - Data Transformations 

Cons : Memory Usahe - is more
       Performance - flexibility can sometimes impact performnace
       Data Access - can be a bottleneck when applications are extensive read only (only reading heavy data)
                      onstrad use SQLDataReader

Wen to use Data Readers : Forward only cursor ( only fetching data)
                          Use memory efficienty
                          Connected
                          Better performance



XML : Extensible Mark up Language
 - It is text based markup lang.
 - it is derived from SGML(Standard Generalized Mark up lang)
 - It is a public standard (w3 open standards)
 - xml tags identify the data that are used to store and organize
 - User defined tags

- XML Usage : simplifies creation of html documents for both small and large scale applications/website
  - Used for storing and exchanging data
  - can express any data type

&lt = <
&amp - &
&apos - '
&quot - "

Xml documents can be created and validated against well formed documents
 1. DTD : Document Type Definition
 2. XDS : Xml Schema Definition

DTD :
<?xml version "1.0">
<!Doctype Employee Management System" employee.dtd>
<Employees>
 <employee>
  <firstname>Amitabh </firstname>
  <lastname>Bachhan</lastname>
 </employee>
 <employee>
  <firstname>Ajith </firstname>
  <lastname>Kumar</lastname>
 </employee>
</Employees>

XSD :
<?xml version="1.0">
<Employee 
   xmlns="https://www.infinite.com"
   xmlns: xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/xmlschema-instance
   xsi:schemaLocation-"http://www.infinite.com employee.xsd>
