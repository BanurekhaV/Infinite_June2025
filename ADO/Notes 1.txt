Activex Data Objects (ADO)


Architecture of ADO :
 1. Connected : applications remain connected through out with the datasource
 2. Disconnected : applications can automatically connect/disconnect during the execution.
                  - temporary data structures called as datasets at the application space

Important classes/objects of ADO
 - Connection :
 - Command : 
     - executeReader() returns an object of type DataReader (used with DQL)
     - executeNonQuery() returns an int (rows affected) (used for DML)
     - executescalar() returns one value or we are looking at only one value

-DataReader : a storage unit known as resultset/recordset

-DataAdapter : 

- Dataset : container objects that contains
            - Data Tables
            - Data Rows
            - Data Columns
            - Data Relationships
            - Data Constraints
