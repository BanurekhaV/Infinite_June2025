LINQ : Language Integrated Query
   - is a query standard to query any data source
   - less code
   - more readable
   - provides intellisense support
   - compile time safe
   - English like 
   - no need to learn many query languages

LINQ to collections 
LINQ to Objects
LINQ to Data Tables
LINQ to SQL

Immediate LINQ  vs Deferred LINQ


Any Linq queries can be executed either as 
Immediate : Greedy Queries (greedy operator)
            Query is executed at the point of declaration/construction
            Aggregate functions, element operators(first, last, single, tolist, toarray, todictionary)

Deferred : Lazy Operator
           Query is not executed at the point of declaration/construction, instead at the time we access the results
           Projection Operators (select, selectmany)
           Restriction operators ( where)
           Paging Operators ( take, skip)
           Avoids unnecessary execution and hence improves performance
           Works always on the latest collection/object


ex : GroupJoin
Person {PId, PName} 

Course {CId, CName}ADO.net, C#.Net, SQL

Employee {}
Department {}

        
LINQ to SQL : is an infrastructure(run-time) for relational data to be managed as an object representation

  Table ------		  Class
  Columns  ----		  Properties
  Rows   ----  		  Instances
  Stored Procedures ----  Methods/Functions

To work with Linq to Sql, we need to convert all entities to Objects. This process is known as Object Relational Mapper (ORM)

- mapped objects are generated/ can be generated using the following options

  1. Visual Studio (Uses Linq to Sql classes, that generates a .dbml file with all the mappings)
  2. SqlMetal.exe (a tool - an executable that generates the mapping as a .dbml file)
