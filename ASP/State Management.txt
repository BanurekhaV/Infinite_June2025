State Management : Storing values across various pages.

Can be achieved using techniques as below:
1. Client Side Technique :
      a) ViewState: is a simple dictionary object that can store data as key and value pair
- does not need any typecasting
- can store any data including UDT
- It stores the data at the client side
- can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page
- cannot travel to other pages

    b) Hidden field : is a control in the toolbox. This will not be visible at runtime
     - is a class that needs to be initialized along with its members that can be a load on the system
     - Like viewstate, this also can retain the state across multiple postbacks of the same page, and not other pages
     - can be used if minimal data needs to be stored

     c) Cookies : Allows managing the state across pages
              - can travel to other pages with the previous state
              - are of 2 types
                   -> Persistent cookies ( uses an object of the HttpCookies class to store data)
                   -> Non-persistent cookies ( Data is directly stored in the response object)

     d) Query Strings : allows to manage the state across pages using URL
              - we can use url encoding to format the data
              - The data is carried from one page to another on the address bar, making it visible.
              - Sensitive data should not be sent via query string

2. Server Side Technique :
