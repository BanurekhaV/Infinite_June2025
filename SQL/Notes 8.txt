Misc. 
isnull() - function used whenever we would like to have a specific value that needs to be returned if the expression value is null
- can be used either in DQL, DML statements
- takes 2 arguments to verify. If we need more values to be compared, then we will give isnull within isnull
    isnull(null,isnull(10,isnull(null,6)))

coalesce() - function that evaluates a list of values and returns the very first non null value
-it is an alternate to isnull()
- it is comparable to case statement, but has an advantage over case, as it is easier to write and less code

RollUp : is an extension of the group by clause to calculate subtotals and grand totals for a set of columns

Cube: is similar to rollup, used with group by clause. It can provide sub and grand totals, for all the permutations of the columns set

--addl func
1. row_number() - allocates numbers based on the rows over a particular column
2. rank() - allocates rank over a particular column, but skips the sequence of the  next number, in case there are more rows taking up the same rank
3.dense_rank() - allocates rank over a particular column, without skipping any sequence
