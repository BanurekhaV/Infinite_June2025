Indexes : are mechanisms to sort the physical order of the data in the database.

Why Indexes ? : without it the query/data modification response may consume lot of the time and effort of the database engine, using a top down approach.

But a single well placed index can shorten the query time from a dozens of minutes to less than a second.
- Speeds up the data access
- May Enforce uniqueness (in case of unique/primary key constraints)
- They occupy disk space

Indexes are of 3 types
 1. Clustered Index : allows only one per table
                      sorts the physical table on every dml operation
                      does not need additional disk space
                      can be just clustered or unique clustered (ensures uniqueness of the data inserted)

 2. Non Clustered Index : allows many indexes per table
                          occupies additional disk space
                          any DML operations does not affect the original table, instead only the index table will be sorted
                          can be either unique or non-unique

 3. Filtered Index : is a non-clustered index with a predicate
                     used in situations where we need only a portion of the index
