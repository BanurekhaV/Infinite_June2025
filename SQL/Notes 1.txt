Database and DBMS : Database can be defined as the storage of inter related data that has been organized in such a fashion, that retrieval becomes efficient and effective

DBMS : are a set of programs to access and manipulate data. It is an environment which is both convenient and efficient

Draw Backs of using file system :
   - Data Redundancy and Inconsistencies
   - Data Isolation - multiple files and formats
   - Difficulty in accessing data
   - Integrity problems
   - Concurrent Usage
   - Security Problems 

Data Model : is a collection of tools for describing
    - Data
    - Data Relationships
    - Data Semantics
    - Data Constraints

Types of Data Model :
  - HDBMS - Hierarchical DBMS
  - NDBMS - Network DBMS
  - RDBMS - Relational DBMS
  - ORDBMS - Object Relational DBMS
              - Multimedia
              - Hyper text based databases

Terms in RDBMS :
- Relation - a table
- Tuple - a row of a table
- Attribute - a column of a table
- Degree - number of attributes
- Cardinality - number of tuples

E-R Modelling
  Entity : is anything that exists and is distinguishable
  Entity Set : a group of similar entities
  Relationship : an association between the entities

Types of Relationships :
  one to one :
  one to many :
  many to many :

SQL - structured query language.
Components of SQL
   - DDL (Data Definition Lang - create, alter, drop, truncate)
   - DML (Data Manipulation Lang - insert, update, delete)
   - DQL (Data Query Lang - select)
   - DCL (Data Control Lang - grant, revoke)
   - TCL (Transaction Control Lang - commit, rollback)

Keys Concept of RDBMS :
  - Candidate Key
  - Primary Key
  - Alternate Key
  - Composite/compounded Key
  - Foreign Key
  - Unique Key

Integrity Constraints : are rules enforced on the data columns of a table. 
  3 types :
  1. Domain Integrity : check, default, null
  2. Entity Integrity : primary key cannot be null/duplicates (primary key)
  3. Referential Integrity : a tuple in one relation refers to another relation (must refer to an existing tuple in that relation) foreign key
