Set Commands : are operators that can work with multiple result sets
Rules for using set commands :
  - The result set of 2 queries must have same number of columns
  - The datatypes of the columns of both the result set should be same
  - The positional ordering of the columns returned as a result of the query must be same
  - We can order only the final result


  Union  -- combines 2 result sets and removes duplicates if any
  Union All -- includes duplicates also
  Intersect -- includes only the common vales of 2 result sets
  Except -- includes the unique values of the first result set as against the 2nd result set

CTE : Common table Expression
  - Are expressions that allow us to define the query output as a temporary storage, which is available only within the execution scope
  - We can perform DML operations
  - We can have multiple CTE's separated with a ','
  - One CTE can refer to another CTE
  - We can recursive CTE's
  - On being referred or used once the CTE will no longer be available

Advantages : Reusability
             More readable
             Does not occupy memory
             Used for Complex queries that can be broken into multiple CTE's

Recursive CTE's : syntax
    with <expression name>(columnlist)
    as
    (  --Anchor member / initial query
       union all
       --recursive memeber that references the <expression name>
       recursive query
   )
