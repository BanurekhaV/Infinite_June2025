	delete   		       vs            truncate
1.  Is a DML command                              Is a DDL command
2.  Can apply where predicate			 Cannot apply any predicates as it operates on the schema objects
3.  Can Rollback				 Cannot Rollback
4.  Is slower than truncate                      Is faster
5.  Retains the Structure                        Retains the structure

Note : Truncated details with data can be also rolled back as a part of the transaction using 
  - Log files,
  - Backup files  by using Sql recovery tool

RDBMS are based on the Relational Algebra Principles
- selection
- projection
- join
- union
- difference
- divide

Operators :
 - Arithmetic
 - Relational
 - Logical

Rules of Precedence on the operators
1. Arithmetic
2. Concatenation
3. Comparison
4. Is[not] null, like, not[in]
5. [not] between
6. Not, And, Or

to override the precedence , use parenthesis ()

Sorting of rows/tuples/records
order by - used to sort the output of a query
         - sort in asc or desc (default is asc)
         - sort multiple columns using a ','
         - sort by alias name 
         - sort by a column that is not in the select list

Group by - divide the tuples of a relation into sub sets/smaller data sets
         - can group on multiple columns
         - cannot group on alias names
         - we have to group on all columns that are a part of the select list except for aggregates
         - we can apply groups by clause on columns that are not a part of the select list(may not get meaningful results that convey the status)

note : cannot have aggregates to the RHS of a where clause

Having clause : restricts the no. of groups, where as 'where' clause restricts no. of rows
- when we need to restrict some sub sets from the output, we filter them using having clause


query execution goes like below :
  - from
  - where
  - group by
  - having
  - order by
  - select

sub queries : are nested queries that can be nested upto 16 levels
  - the inner query executes first and the result are used by the main query
  - after the inner queries execution, it is removed from the program scope

Guidelines for using subqueries:
  - Enclose subqueries in parenthesis
  - place the subqueries on the right hand side of the comparison operator
  - use single row operators for single row subquery and multi row operators for multi row subquery

Single Row Operators : =, >, <, <>, <=, >=

Multi Row Operators :
  in : Matches any member in the list (works like a logical or)

  any : Compares value with each values returned by the subquery, to see if any one value matches the criteria
        - can be used in conjunction with single row operators

  all : Compares value with each values returned by the subquery, to see if all values matches the criteria
        - can be used in conjunction with single row operators
