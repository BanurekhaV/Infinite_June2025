Soft delete : where a row that has to be deleted is actually updated with some value in one of the columns

DDL Triggers : are of 2 types
  1. Database scoped triggers - are applicable on the DDL Events of a particular database
  2. Server scoped triggers - are applicable on the DDL Events of a all the databases of the server

Cursors : are objects that store the result set of any query and allows traversal over the rows

They are of 2 types :
  - Implicit cursors : are created by the database engine automatically and processed
  - Explicit cursors : are user defined that can be created, traversed, manipulated by the user programs

Life Cycle :
  1. Declare a cursor
  2. Open the cursor
  3. Fetch the data as along as there are rows
  4. Close the cursor
  5. Deallocate the cursor

Cursor Traversal :
  1. Forward only : cursors that can move forward only (1st, 2nd 3rd...)
  2. Static cursor : cursors that do not reflect any changes made after opening it
  3. Dynamic cursor : cursors that reflect any changes made after opening it
  4. Keyset cursor : cursors that are driven by a unique value

Cursors Vs While

--Cursors are updatable
--Cursors can move forward and backwards using First, Last, Next, Prior, Relative, Absolute
--Cursors have varied options to behave with regards to locking while updations
--Cursors don't need any condition as a test 
--Global Cursors can be passed to stored procedures 

Cons
 --Global Cursors are a risk when faced with cursor errors due to the cursor being closed by some stored procedure
 --Cursors are slower in performance, than a while or CTE's

While Loops  Pros :
 --are faster than cursors
 --uses less amounts of locks
 --Less usage of tempdb

Cons 
  --Moving back and forth is not possible
  --Risk of infinite looping


File Groups : are basically collection of file objects. primary group is the default group, where all data and transaction files are stored.

whenever we create a database, sql server creates 2 files
  - A data file (.mdf)
  - Transaction log file (.ldf)

Secondary file group (.ndf)
