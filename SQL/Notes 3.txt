Corelated subquery : is a way of reading every row in a table and comparing values in each row against the related data.

-- is executed once for each row of the outer query
-- the inner query uses the values of the outer and hence become dependent
-- used for row-specific filtering, ranking, or calculations based on other related data

identity columns : are like primary keys
                  - it is autogenerated number
                  - it is of type integer
                  - can be applied to any integer column
                  - does not allow insertion of data into the column

bulk copy / insertions : data insertions from source and destination object when the structures are same between both

    // insert into destination select * from source

--if source and destination have varied structures, then we can specify the columns that we want to insert both in source and destination as
  
  // insert into destination(col, col ..) select col, col, .. from source

Case : works as alternates for any condition

 Simple Case : case keyword is immediately followed by case expression and before a when statement

 Searched Case : case keyword is followed by when statement. There is no case expression between case and when statements

Nested Case : Case within a case
