ASP.NET Session is an object to store information about the user 
-It can be used for passing data between models/controllers to the view page 
-It's value doesn’t become null after passing information until we manually set it to null or session   	times expires. 
-By default, in ASP.NET MVC, session time is 20 minutes and we can increase or decrease time upon needs.

Tuples - What are Tuples in ASP.NET MVC?
 - It is immutable, fixed-size and ordered sequence object. 
 - It is a data structure that has a specific number and sequence of elements and it supports up to 7 to 8 elements. 
 - We can use Tuples for passing multiple models in a single view page.
 - Pass the models in Tuple<model1, model2, model3,….model7> brackets and then pass the respective action method in sequence that is mapped with model, like (function1, function2, function3,….function7)
 -  Add tuples in the beginning of the view page and pass models name in parameter, as below

@model Tuple<ItemModel, List<ReviewersModel>>  (as per our Demo)
