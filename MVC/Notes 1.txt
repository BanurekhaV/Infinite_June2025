ASP.Net MVC : is a popular framework for developing web applications


Features of MVC Pattern :
 - Allows Clear separation of concerns ( Designs and Codes are neatly separated)
 - Based on Model View and Controller pattern
 - It is light weight, fast and secure
 - It uses Pure HTML controls or HTML Helpers(No Server Control)
 - It uses controller based URL
 - Implements no view state
 - It uses Layouts in place of Master Pages for consistent look and feel
 - It uses Razor Syntax for customization
 - ASP.Net MVC is open source framework

Understanding MVC
Model : responsible for keeping database operational logic 
Controller : responsible for programming logics
View : responsible for serving the webpage to the client (UI)

Controller : is the main part of the MVC appln.
- Is a mediator between client side request and server side response
- Acts like a bridge between View Page and Models
- Works with HTTP request that comes from the browser
- Even when a static resource is requested , the controller comes in action and returns the requested page
- Each request is mapped to a controller and each controller has several action methods to handle the request
- In MVC, URL's are not mapped with a direct static page, instead with controllers
- All controllers must have a suffix 'controller' after the name of the controller

-- Action Methods : are methods inside the controller.
  - Must be public
  - Cannot be overloaded
  - Cannot be static
  - Every controller has one action method (Index()) by default, that returns a view

ActionResult - is the base class of all the result types of action
Result Types :
  1. View Result : html and razor
  2. Empty Result : no result
  3. RedirectResult : redirection to a new url
  4. JsonResult : json result type
  5. ContentResult : a textual or html result
  6. FileContentResult : downloadable binary content
  7. FilePathResult : downloadable with path specifications
  8. FileStreamResult : downloadable with a specified file stream
  9 JavaScript Result : html result

Views : is a folder structure of MVC application.
- contains all .cshtml files under different folders that correspond to the controller, along with shared .cshtml files
- view folder name and .cshtml files represent the controller name and the action method name respectively.
- allows us to write razor syntax - a powerful and easier mark up syntax
                    - way of writing the server code directly on to the html based view page
                    - Uses '@{}' block to write program code
                    - All inline expressions like variables, functions etc start with @
                    - variables are declared using var keyword, and ';' can be used to terminate
                    - Comments in razor are given with
                          @*......*@ - multiline comments
                          /* ... */
                          //  - single line
- to bind the model to the view, we use @model
- @Model helps in accessing the properties of the bound model Object
