Routing : Defines the URL Pattern and the handler information

Conventional Routing :

https://localhost/44336/  ==> search the routeconfig.cs for the pattern

https://localhost/44336/home ==> (action = index, id=optional)

https://localhost/44336/home/index  ==> (id=optional)

https://localhost/44336/home/index/5 ==> retrieves the record 5 of the index of Home

Attribute Routing : Define routes using [Route]

--We have to enable attribute routing in routeconfig.cs

--Decorate with the [Route]

Advantages of attribute based routing
 1. It gives us more control. We can create hierarchical URL Pattern
 (students have courses, orders have products, departments have employees)
 2. Reduces the chance of error
 3. May decouple the controller and action name 
 4. Easy to map 2 routes pointing to same action 

RoutePrefix : is a common attribute placed on a controller, for all the action methods of a controller

--To override the RoutePrefix , use a "~  symbol along with a different route)

--Route Contraints : can be applied on different action methods 
 - int  - 32 bit integer
 - alpha - matches upper/lower alphabets
 - bool - 
 - datetime 
 - guid 
 - length - string with specified length
 - max, min, minlength, maxlength, long, range, regex
