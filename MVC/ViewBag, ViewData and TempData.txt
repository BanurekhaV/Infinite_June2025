ViewBag, ViewData and TempData : are objects that are used to pass information/data from controller to view

ViewBag : Dynamic Data Type
 - used to transfer data from controller to view
 - has short life, meaning once the data is passed from controller to the view, it becomes null.
 - does not need any typecasting

Eg : ViewBag.Mydata = "Data 1";

and to access the viewBag data in the view page
    @ViewBag.Mydata
 

ViewData : is a dictionary object that is derived from ViewDataDictionary
 - uses key/value pair for storing and retrieving data
 - used to transfer data from controller to view
 - has short life, meaning once the data is passed from controller to the view, it becomes null.
 - requires typecasting

Eg : ViewData["Data2"] = "Data Two";

to access
ViewData["Data2"]


TempData : is a dictionary object that is derived from TempDataDictionary
 - uses key/value pair for storing and retrieving data
 - used to transfer data from controller to view
 - internally makes use of session to store the values
 - always check for null before using tempdata to avoid runtime errors
 - requires typecasting
 - has bigger life than viewbag and viewdata
 - it is generally used to transfer data/values from one controller to another
