Code First Using Repository Pattern

Repository Pattern : is a structural pattern that abstracts the data access, providing a centralized way to manage data operations
- it is an intermediary layer between an applications business logic and data storage (enhanced code maintainability, testability, flexibility, and making it easier to work with different data sources) 


Asynchronous Controllers : It is like a normal controller with views, differing only as below:
 - Return type is prefixed with async modifier - notifying that the method returns data asynchronously
 - They are task based Task<ActionResult> that returns a value
 - Wherever we have data related actions, we will make use of await keyword to wait for the data from the source
 - We use ToListAsync() instead of ToList()


HTML Helpers : are C# methods that are used to return HTML. Using the helpers we can render all HTML controls(image, textbox, anchor, button)

Types of HTML Helpers :
1. Inline Html helper : are used on a single view of the same page. They are created using @helper tag

Eg : @helper MyInlineHelper(string[] words)
{
   <ol>
    @foreach(string s in words)
{
    <li>@s</l1>
}
</ol>
}

2. Built in Helpers

3. Standard Html Helper : are used to render typical html elements

 Eg : @Html.Action()  -- to create link tags
      @Html.TextBox()
      @Html.BeginForm()  -- to start a form action

4. Strongly Typed Html Helper : These take lambda expressions with parameters and informs the helper which property of the model has to be used
 Eg : @Html.LabelFor(model=>model.ID)
       @Html.TextBoxFor();

5. Templated Html Helper : is used for data display and input. Generates Html automatically as per the model property and also for the complete model with just a single Tag. It has 2 types
    1. Display Template : @Html.Display(), @Html.DisplayFor()

       @Html.DisplayForModel()  //single tag for entire model

    2. Editor Template : @Html.Editor(), @html.EditorFor()
     
        @Html.EditorForModel();

 6. Custom Html Helper : Users Preferences in the views. These can be of 2 types
     1. Static Helpers
     2. Extension Helpers
