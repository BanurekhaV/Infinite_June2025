Software Engineering Principles : guides the development of software system to ensure quality, maintainability, efficiency of code, reusability etc..

 1. Separation of Concern : Divide the program into distinct sections, thereby enhancing the modularity
 2. Abstraction (what rather than how)
 3. Anticipation of Change : 
        - Generality (de-coupled codes)
        - Incremental Development
        - Consistency of Look and feel
 4. DRY : Do Not Repeat Yourselves
 5. KISS : Keep it Simple ! Stupid
 6. YAGNI : You Aren't Gonna Need It (avoid features and functions that are not required)
 7. SOLID :
