Remoting : is a mechanism for communication, between objects of various applications that are not in the same process(Domain), nor in the same system
 - The applications may be using different transport protocols, Serialization Formats etc.
 - Is a Microsoft framework for communication between remote objects
 - Provides ways to hide various aspects of remote communication viz. managing connections, marshalling of data, reading writing xml/soap messages 
 - Provides services like
   - object activation
   - life time support of objects
   - communication channels
   - transport messages

Domain : When an Application is loaded onto the memory, a process is created within that application. This is Application Domain

Contexts : Application Domain is divided into various contexts. 
           A context is a set of common constraints, usage, access, functionalities within the object

Proxies : is an instance of the remote object directly available to the consumer/client. It does all the marshalling across context and then forwards the request to the actual remote object

Marshalling : Specifies how a remote object is exposed to the client. The process of passing parameters from one context to another is of 2 types
   - Marshal by value : the server creates a copy of the object and passes the copy to the client
   - MarshalByRef : the client creates a proxy for the object and then uses the proxy for further processing

Channels : is a mechanism that allows data transfers through a stream of bytes
           HttpChannel, TcpChannel

Types of Remote objects :
 1. Single Call : Objects that server one request
 2. Singleton : Objects that serve multiple requests of multiple clients. The server maintains the state of each client
 3. Client Activated Objects : Upon clients request for a remote object, the instance of the required object is activated, and the reference of the object is sent back to the client. A proxy object gets created at the client. All calls/request are executed on the proxy.

Technologies for Remote applications
 -Remote procedure calls (RPC)
 - DCOM (Distributed COM)
 - Remoting - replace of DCOM
 - Web Services
 - WCF
 - API

steps for Remoting :
 1. Class Library where all remote objects are created
 2. Console Application - Server (Host the remote application/objects)
 3. Client Application
