Arrays : are continuous memory allocation of the same type with a fixed size
         are reference types

Types of arrays : Single Dimension
 ex int[] a = new int[5];
int[] a = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5};
int[] a = new int[]={10,20,30,40,50};

                  Two Dimension / Multi
ex : int[,]table = new int[4,3];

                  Jagged Arrays :
- are often called array of arrays
- every element of jagged array is an array itself

ex : int[][] jarr = new int[3][];
  jarr[0] = new int[]{1,2,3};
jarr[1]= new int[]{4,5,6,7,8};
jarr[2]= new int[]{9,10};


Instance Members: are members that are avilable as a copy to each and every object that is created.
                  They are accessed only with the object reference

 Static members : are known as class members
                  only one copy exists for the entire class
                  they are managed and mainted by the CLR
                  are accessed only with the class name 


Strings :
- are a collection of characters
- are predefined reference types
- memory is allocated on the heap
- strings have fixed size
- strings are immutable
- strings memory cannot be changed
