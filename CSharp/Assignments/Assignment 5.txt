Inheritance:

1. Create a class called Accounts which has data members/fields like Account no, Customer name, Account type, Transaction type (d/w), amount, balance
D->Deposit
W->Withdrawal

-write a function that updates the balance depending upon the transaction type

	-If transaction type is deposit call the function credit by passing the amount to be deposited and update the balance

  function  Credit(int amount) 

	-If transaction type is withdraw call the function debit by passing the amount to be withdrawn and update the balance

  Debit(int amt) function 

-Pass the other information like Account no, customer name, acc type through constructor

-write and call the show data method to display the values.

2. Create a class called student which has data members like rollno, name, class, Semester, branch, int [] marks=new int marks [5](marks of 5 subjects )

-Pass the details of student like rollno, name, class, SEM, branch in constructor

-For marks write a method called GetMarks() and give marks for all 5 subjects

-Write a method called displayresult, which should calculate the average marks

-If marks of any one subject is less than 35 print result as failed
-If marks of all subject is >35,but average is < 50 then also print result as failed
-If avg > 50 then print result as passed.

-Write a DisplayData() method to display all object members values.

3. Create a class called Saledetails which has data members like Salesno,  Productno,  Price, dateofsale, Qty, TotalAmount
- Create a method called Sales() that takes qty, Price details of the object and updates the TotalAmount as  Qty *Price
- Pass the other information like SalesNo, Productno, Price,Qty and Dateof sale through constructor
- call the show data method to display the values without an object.

Exception Handling :  
1.
•	You have a class which has methods for transaction for a banking system. (created earlier)
•	Define your own methods for deposit money, withdraw money and balance in the account.
•	Write your own new application Exception class called InsuffientBalanceException. 
•	This new Exception will be thrown in case of withdrawal of money from the account where customer doesn’t have sufficient balance.
•	Identify and categorize all possible checked and unchecked exception.

2. Create a class called Scholarship which has a function Public void Merit() that takes marks and fees as an input. 
If the given mark is >= 70 and <=80, then calculate scholarship amount as 20% of the fees
If the given mark is > 80 and <=90, then calculate scholarship amount as 30% of the fees
If the given mark is >90, then calculate scholarship amount as 50% of the fees.
In all the cases return the Scholarship amount, else throw an user exception

Indexers:

3. Create a class called Books with BookName and AuthorName as members. Instantiate the class through constructor and also write a method Display() to display the details. 

Create an Indexer of Books Object to store 5 books in a class called BookShelf. Using the indexer method assign values to the books and display the same.

Hint(use Aggregation/composition)
