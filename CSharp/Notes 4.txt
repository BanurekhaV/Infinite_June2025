Inheritance : extensions of the capabilities of a class

are of the following types
 1. Single
 2. Multi level
 3. Hybrid
No multiple inheritance is supported in C#

There are 2 types of relations broadly 
  1. 'is a relationship' - inheritance
  2. 'has a relationship' (composition/aggregation)

Polymorphism : Ability of an object to respond differently to different messages/ different objects responding differently to the same message
  - Overloading : 1)function overloading
         - are functions with the same name and different signatures in terms of the arguments(i.e. either in the number of arguments or in the data type) 
         - is a concept with a single class
         - we can achieve static polymorphism/compile time polymorphism/early binding (function resolution)          
 
                  2)operator overloading :

       int a=5, b=6,c=0;
  c = a+b;  //11

class example { }

 example e1, e2, e3;
e3=e1+e2;
